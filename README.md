# AINSB - AI Navigation System for the Blind
The aim of this project is to develop a prototype device that helps to enable safe navigation for the blind/visually impaired in various environments. This is a research project done in partial fulfillment of the BSc. Electronics Engineering at UWI Mona.

## Project Overview
According to the project requirements, the primary objectives of the project are to:
* Identify various objects in the path of the user
* Estimate the distance of those objects from the user
* Provide auditory and/or tactile feedback to direct the user

The secondary/stretch objectives include:
* Apply face recognition to identify persons familiar to the user of the device 
* Accept voice commands from the user 

As such, the software implementation of the project up to this point has been divided into the following section:
* Face Recognition
* Depth Estimation
* Object Detection
* Text to Speech
* Tactile Feedback

Each of the previously mentioned sections contain the code and files that were used during the R&D process for each of those tasks, and all code can be found in the src folder.
